    "3. Creating a Thread Pool : The `ThreadPoolExecutor` object which manage a pool of threads `with` that executor is properly cleaned after executed(All Threads are shutdown)\n",
    "4. Submitting Task to Executor: Here a list comprehension is used to submit the task function to executor 10 times (Range 0 to 9)\n",
    "5. Collecting Results: `results = [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]` this line waits for each future to complete and collect result. `futures.as_completed(futures)` iterates over the futures as they complete(Not Nec. in order they were submitted)\n",
    "6. print result\n",

    "##### **Task 2**: Explanation of \"Submit\" and \"Collect\" Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Submit**: In the context of parallel programming, \"submitting a task\" refers to the act of sending a function or a callable object to an executor (like `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `ProcessPoolExecutor`) for execution. The executor schedules the task and returns a `Future` object that acts as a placeholder for the result of the task. This allows the main thread to continue executing without waiting for the task to complete immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect**: \"Collecting a task\" refers to retrieving the results of the submitted tasks once they are completed. This is done by calling methods like `future.result()` on the Future objects returned when the tasks were submitted. This step is necessary to gather the outputs of the parallel computations and process them further."
